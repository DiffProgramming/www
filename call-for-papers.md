### Submission instructions

We welcome submissions in the broad area of differentiable programming, including (but not limited to) work related to: 
* Differentiable programming languages design, abstractions, frameworks and tools.
* Program analysis and transformations for differentiable programming.
* Frameworks using differentiable programming such as probabilistic programming, differentiable simulators, and differentiable optimization.
* Scientific and industrial applications, such as differentiable protein-folding, differentiable molecular dynamics, differentiable physics in robotics, end-to-end model-based reinforcement learning.

We would like to facilitate a discussion of the latest advancements, questions, and challenges in the differentiable programming field. Thus, we encourage authors to submit preliminary work, work-in-progress, and other recent work that has not been previously published. 

Papers should be of up to 6 pages (not including references) and they should use the [NeurIPS 2021 LaTeX template](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). 

Submitted papers are non-archival. The reviewing process will be double-blind and will assess the papers based on clarity, novelty, and relevance to the broad field of differentiable programming.
